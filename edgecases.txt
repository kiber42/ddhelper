Dungeon modifiers: "Fewer glyphs", "Extra glyphs"
-------------------------------------------------
(Tested for The Labyrinth)
Regular: 5 spells, 100 conversion points
Fewer glyphs: 4 spells, 150 conversion points
More glyphs: 6 spells, 80 conversion points
More and fewer glyphs (daily dungeon only): 6 spells, 130 conversion points

Possible algorithm:
Set #spells to regular (5), 100 conversion points
1. Fewer glyphs?
Set #glyphs to regular - 1, add 50 conversion points
2. More glyphs?
Set #glyphs to regular + 1, subtract 20 conversion points

Essence Transit health point gain is awarded after damage is taken (if still alive)

Mana shield damage against monster with magic resistance:
Damage done is rounded down (not the amount of resisted damage as is usually done!)

Retaliate damage: 50% of regular damage

Crushing blow ignores resistances and even physical immunity (magical not tested)

Health regeneration bonus for bloody sigil is applied after x2 multiplier from discipline
