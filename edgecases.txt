Edge cases
==========
Dungeon modifiers: "Fewer glyphs", "Extra glyphs"
-------------------------------------------------
(Tested for The Labyrinth)
Regular: 5 spells, 100 conversion points
Fewer glyphs: 4 spells, 150 conversion points
More glyphs: 6 spells, 80 conversion points
More and fewer glyphs (daily dungeon only): 6 spells, 130 conversion points

Possible algorithm:
Set #spells to regular (5), 100 conversion points
1. Fewer glyphs?
Set #glyphs to regular - 1, add 50 conversion points
2. More glyphs?
Set #glyphs to regular + 1, subtract 20 conversion points

Order of effects in combat
--------------------------
Damage is almost always computed using the initial hero and monster
Known exceptions:
  - Health from Life Steal is added directly after hero's strike
  - A Curse Bearer monster will curse the hero directly after the hero's strike
  - Warlord's 30% damage bonus if hero's health is below 50% at the time of his attack

Essence Transit health point gain is awarded after damage is taken (if still alive)

Misc
----
Mana shield damage against monster with magic resistance:
Damage done is rounded down (not the amount of resisted damage as is usually done!)

Retaliate damage: 50% of regular damage

Crushing blow ignores resistances and even physical immunity (not tested: vs. magical immunity, i.e. using Half-Dragon)

Health regeneration bonus for bloody sigil is applied after x2 multiplier from discipline

Petrifying a monster removes one curse stack, even if the monster was cursed

Burn down damage is magical damage, magical resistance applies

Jehora also reacts to teleportation attempts that failed because of magic resistance

Converting a spell that is small (Wizard / Compression Seal) yields a reward of 2 piety from Glowing guardian, except for the evil spells (Apheelsik and Blutopowa) which allows yield 10
