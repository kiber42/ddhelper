# To-Do's and Ideas

- Importer:
  - Better support for Windows
  - Import hero class and level
  - Import remaining hero stats
  - Import hero statuses
  - Import hero's' inventory
  - Recognize slowed, burning, and poisoned monster statuses
  - Could use monster portraits for more robust identification
  - Import spells and items from map?
  - Import map (walls, blocked tiles, etc.)?
- Solver:
  - Keep improving! Keep looking for alternative approaches.
  - Genetic algorithm: Instead of one long chain of steps, break solution into steps per monster and optimize those?
  - Combine algorithms
  - Find good way to test genetic solver (deal with randomness)
- UI:
  - Make more compact. Some ideas:
    - Have more foldable elements
    - Merge standard and custom hero builder
    - Merge standard and custom monster builder
    - Use other UI elements for ease of use and compactness
    - Consider using icons (for hero, monsters, items, spells, altars; but also for action buttons)?
  - Keep improving heuristics window (could add buttons to apply suggested actions?)
  - Allow removing a monster from the pool
  - Allow editing a monster in the pool (or to move it to the monster builder?)
  - Allow saving/loading scenarios?
  - Allow starting equipment for hero
- Engine:
  - Support for actual maps (rather than a list of resources and monsters)
  - Support for dungeons with subdungeons?
  - Also see numerous TODO items in code
- Build:
  - Use Conan for packages?
  - Separate CMake file for imgui
  - Make all dependencies optional.  For example, the engine package can built without any of the imgui, OpenGL, SDL, OpenCV dependencies.
  - Try to get cygwin build to work again?
- General:
  - Tag known good versions once in a while
  - Create a dev branch and merge to main. Squash related commits.
